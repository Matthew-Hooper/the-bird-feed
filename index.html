            I came up with the idea for this site mainly by searching for animal APIs to mess around me. 
            I'm very fond of birds and when I found an API for facts and images, I knew I had to do it.  
            The nerd in me was excited to make sure of the APIs, especially for random facts no one cares about, and the bird lover in me jumped on in.
